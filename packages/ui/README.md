# TaskManager UI

This is a NextJS application, it provides a User Interface to manage tasks.

## Installation

This should be installed using lerna from the repository root

## Running

This should be run using lerna from the repository root.

## Usage

Hopefully the application should be self-explanatory in how it is used. An 'Add Task' button is available in the NavBar
to allow the first task to be added. From the individual task cards a task can be edited and deleted

### Challenge thoughts and notes

The intention for the look and feel was a cut-down Trello.

I used the documentation sites for multiple different packages to complete this task including

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

Plus additional resources when encountering issues I did not know how to fix from memory

Additional functionality that could have been added

- Authentication/authorization
- Logging to an external provider
- Handle loading states better
- Drag and drop tasks between states
- Tests!
